Bio-RNA-RNAaliSplit 0.07

Bio::RNA::RNAaliSplit is a distribution of Perl modules for splitting and
deconvoluting structural RNA multiple sequence alignments (MSA). Its
primary purpose is to partition a MSA into subsets of sequences that have a
common consensus structure which is different from the consesus structure
of the other set. Another application is cleaning MSA from sequence that do
not fold into or prohibit folding into a common consensus structure.

This distribution is shipped with an executable script, RNAalisplit.pl,
which takes a RNA MSA in ClustalW format and performs the deconvolution.

THIRD PARTY DEPENDENCIES

This module depends heavily on third party RNA bioinformatics software.

It requires the ViennaRNA Package v2.3.4 or above (available from
http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA ). Specifically, the 'RNAalifold',
'AnalyseDists' executables as well as the RNA Perl module shipped with
ViennaRNA are used by RNAaliSplit.

RNAz (availale from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~wash/RNAz) is used for
classification of split subalignments.

R-scape 0.6.1 (availavle from http://www.eddylab.org/R-scape) is used for
computing statistically significant covariation in base pairs.

Be sure to have all dependencies up and running on your system (and
available to the Perl interpreter) before continuing the installation
process.
